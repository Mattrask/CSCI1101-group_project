method will use 2D array for the rooms (as Geoff mentioned)
will show: Unexplored rooms, explored rooms, room player is in, and no rooms

output will look like:
	[.][.][u][.][.]
	[u][.][u][u][.]
	[u][x][e][u][u]
	[.][.][e][.][.]
	[.][.][e][.][.]

[.]= no room
[u]= unexplored
[x]= player location
[e]= explored rooms
